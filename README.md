# Time-Crunch

## Description

We created a patient doctor application that provides the user with a interactive and efficient way of Scheduling appointmets. The application works by the following:

1. User logs in.
2. Then the user is routed to a profile page where they input thier personal information.
3. The user is then routed to an appointment page where they can add, update or delete scheduled appointments.
